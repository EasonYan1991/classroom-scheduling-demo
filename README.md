# Class Scheduling Algorithm Demo

I want to create (or welcome contributions) to develop a solution for a simple scenario: scheduling university classes across a limited set of classrooms over a week. I'd strongly prefer a mathematical approach using linear algebra techniques rather than a brute-force approach. 

This is purely an exercise for my own (and others') learning. 

Preferred languages are Python, Java, or Kotlin. 

Here is a starting data set: 

**Classrooms:**

1) Psych 101 (1 hour, 2 sessions/week)
2) English 101 (1.5 hours, 2 sessions/week)
3) Math 300 (1.5 hours, 2 sessions/week)
4) Psych 300 (3 hours, 1 session/week)
5) Calculus I (2 hours, 3 sessions/week)
6) Calculus II (2 hours, 3 sessions/week)
7) Sociology 101 (1 hour, 2 sessions/week)
8) Sociology 102 (1 hour, 2 sessions/week)


**Rooms:**

* ROOM A
* ROOM B
* ROOM C

**Availability for each day of week:**

* 8:00AM-11:30AM
* 1:00PM-5:00PM


Obviously, a room cannot be occupied by more than one class at any time.
